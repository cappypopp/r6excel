VBA macros for making working with Salesforce Radian6 data easier

You'll need to copy these changes to your Excel Personal Macro Workbook or the Workbook in which you need these macros available. There are a ton of things to understand about how to deploy and use macros in Excel; I won't attempt to cover them here. The most important thing is that you'll likely have to _turn them on_ in order to use them as the default in most Excel installations is for them to be disabled. I will provide links to make it easier:

* [Macro Security in Excel](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/change-macro-security-settings-in-excel-HP010342232.aspx)
* [Sharing Macros Between Workbooks Using a Personal Workbook](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/copy-your-macros-to-a-personal-macro-workbook-HA102174076.aspx)
* [Creating an Excel Addin](http://www.ozgrid.com/VBA/excel-add-in-create.htm)

Creating an AddIn is likely the easiest way to install but YMMV. There is no 'perfect' way to share VBA code thanks to its reputation for being used for nefarious purposes. If you have any questions, just ask me at [@cappypopp](http://twitter.com/cappypopp) or here in this project.
